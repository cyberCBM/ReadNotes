## There will be code :) forever.
**As a developer/programmer defend your code:** If you were a doctor and had a patient who demanded that 
you stop all the silly hand washing in preparation for surgery because it was taking too much time? 
clearly the patient is the boss and yet the doctor should absolutely refuse to comply 
**WHY?** because the doctor knows more than patient about the risk of disease and infection. 
it would be unprofessional (never mind criminals)for the doctor to comply with the patients.

###	Only way to go fast ---> is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.
